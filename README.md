# Project Description

Created an end-to-end Machine Learning model using a Random Forest regressor to predict the count of rented bikes and made a web app deployed over Flask. The dataset has been fetched from UCI ML Repo with dataid=275.
This dataset provides a comprehensive record of bike rental patterns, encompassing various environmental and temporal factors. This dataset contains the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the Capital bike-share system with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.
